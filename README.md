## About the project
In this Ironhack project I was tasked with creating my first software using Python.
I chose the classic Mastermind game.

## Mastermind
In Mastermind, one player picks a secret code that consists of 4 pegs of 6 different colors. The colors can be repeated, meaning the code may be 4 green pegs. 
The second player has to guess the code. He has 12 attempts. 
After each attempt, the first player will provide feedback to help the second player guess the code. 
They will provide a black peg for each color peg that is the right color, in the right place.
They will provide a white peg for each color peg that is the right color, but in the wrong place. 
For the sake of simplicity, I have made it a numeric code (with numbers from 0 to 5).

## Project Goals
During this project I learned to:
* Fork and manage my own git repository. 
* Create a folder /game/ to wrap my code files.
* Build my own code from scratch. 
* Include a README.MD for my game.
* Put into practice the basic python concepts learned during the past weeks.

## Planning
This project was planned with a Kanban board on Trello. You can find a screenshot in the repository. 

## Roadmap
The project can be further improved by creating a physical board. This could be done in the code itself or with Pygame.
